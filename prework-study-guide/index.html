      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which
        work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web. Please read further for more
        information on the different HTML elements.
      </p>
      <h3>HEAD</h3>
      <p>The <b>HEAD</b> element is a container which contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to
        render the page correctly. Elements included within the <b>HEAD</b> are not visible when a user looks at a
        webpage. The tags used inside a <b>HEAD</b> include:
      <ul>
        <li><b>title:</b> element sets the title of the webpage. This information is useful as it is used by Search
          engines to
          rank and list your website in search results. </li>
        <li><b>base:</b> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
        <li><b>link:</b> element connects an external resource to the HTML document. </li>
        <li><b>style:</b> element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
        <li><b>meta:</b> element defines metadata about the website. These include:
          <ul>
            <li><b>keywords:</b> kw used by search engines. </li>
            <li><b>description:</b> description about the website. </li>
            <li><b>viewport:</b> Is the user’s visible area of a webpage on a device. It varies from one device to
              another.
              It’s smaller on a mobile device and more on a desktop.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>BODY</h3>
      <p>The <b>BODY</b> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user
        to see and interact with must be placed inside this element. Listed below are few of the tags used within the
        <b>BODY</b>:
        include:
      <ul>
        <li><b>h1...h6:</b> heading elements to represent Title/subtitles. They should appear in order. And only one h1
          for the entire page. It is a block level element.
